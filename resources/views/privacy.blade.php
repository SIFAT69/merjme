        services (collectively, &quot;Services&quot;). This Agreement is legally
        binding between you (&quot;User&quot;, &quot;you&quot; or
        &quot;your&quot;) and MerjMe (&quot;MerjMe&quot;, &quot;we&quot;,
        &quot;us&quot; or &quot;our&quot;). By accessing and using the Services,
        you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by

        behalf of a business or other legal entity, you represent that you have the
        authority to bind such entity to this Agreement, in which case the terms
        &quot;User&quot;, &quot;you&quot; or &quot;your&quot; shall refer to such
        entity. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with the terms
        of this Agreement, you must not accept this Agreement and may not access
        and use the Services. You acknowledge that this Agreement is a contract
        between you and MerjMe, even though it is electronic and is not physically
        signed by you, and it governs your use of the Services.</p>
        <h2>Accounts and membership</h2>
        <p>If you create an account on the Services, you are responsible for
        maintaining the security of your account and you are fully responsible for all
        activities that occur under the account and any other actions taken in
        connection with it. We may monitor and review new accounts before you may
        sign in and start using the Services. Providing false contact information of
        any kind may result in the termination of your account. You must immediately
        notify us of any unauthorized uses of your account or any other breaches of
        security. We will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any
        damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions. We may
        suspend, disable, or delete your account (or any part thereof) if we
        determine that you have violated any provision of this Agreement or that your
        conduct or content would tend to damage our reputation and goodwill. If we
        delete your account for the foregoing reasons, you may not re-register for
        our Services. We may block your email address and Internet protocol address
        to prevent further registration.</p>
        <h2>User content</h2>
        <p>We do not own any data, information or material (collectively,
        &quot;Content&quot;) that you submit on the Services in the course of using
        the Service. You shall have sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality,
        integrity, legality, reliability, appropriateness, and intellectual property
        ownership or right to use of all submitted Content. We may, but have no
        obligation to, monitor and review the Content on the Services submitted or
        created using our Services by you. You grant us permission to access, copy,
        distribute, store, transmit, reformat, display and perform the Content of your
        user account solely as required for the purpose of providing the Services to
        you. Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, we have the
        right, though not the obligation, to, in our own sole discretion, refuse or
        remove any Content that, in our reasonable opinion, violates any of our
        policies or is in any way harmful or objectionable. Unless specifically
        permitted by you, your use of the Services does not grant us the license to
        use, reproduce, adapt, modify, publish or distribute the Content created by
        you or stored in your user account for commercial, marketing or any similar
        purpose.</p>
        <h2>Adult content</h2>
        <p>Please be aware that there may be certain adult or mature content
        available on the Services. Where there is mature or adult content, individuals
        who are less than 18 years of age or are not permitted to access such
        content under the laws of any applicable jurisdiction may not access such
        content. If we learn that anyone under the age of 18 seeks to conduct a
        transaction through the Services, we will require verified parental consent, in
        accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998
        (&quot;COPPA&quot;). Certain areas of the Services may not be available to
        children under 18 under any circumstances.</p>
        <h2>Backups</h2>
        <p>We perform regular backups of the Website and its Content, however,
        these backups are for our own administrative purposes only and are in no
        way guaranteed. You are responsible for maintaining your own backups of
        your data. We do not provide any sort of compensation for lost or incomplete
        data in the event that backups do not function properly. We will do our best
        to ensure complete and accurate backups, but assume no responsibility for
        this duty.</p>
        <h2>Advertisements</h2>
        <p>During your use of the Services, you may enter into correspondence with
        or participate in promotions of advertisers or sponsors showing their goods

        conditions, warranties or representations associated with such activity, is
        solely between you and the applicable third party. We shall have no liability,
        obligation or responsibility for any such correspondence, purchase or
        promotion between you and any such third party.</p>
        <h2>Links to other resources</h2>
        <p>Although the Services may link to other resources (such as websites,
        mobile applications, etc.), we are not, directly or indirectly, implying any
        approval, association, sponsorship, endorsement, or affiliation with any
        linked resource, unless specifically stated herein. Some of the links on the
        Services may be &quot;affiliate links&quot;. This means if you click on the

        access through a link on the Services. Your linking to any other off-site
        resources is at your own risk.</p>

        such property will remain (as between the parties) solely with MerjMe. All

        opportunity) however caused, under any theory of liability, including, without
        limitation, contract, tort, warranty, breach of statutory duty, negligence or
        otherwise, even if the liable party has been advised as to the possibility of
        such damages or could have foreseen such damages. To the maximum
        extent permitted by applicable law, the aggregate liability of MerjMe and its
        affiliates, officers, employees, agents, suppliers and licensors relating to the

        actually paid in cash by you to MerjMe for the prior one month period prior to
        the first event or occurrence giving rise to such liability. The limitations and
        exclusions also apply if this remedy does not fully compensate you for any
        losses or fails of its essential purpose.</p>
        <h2>Indemnification</h2>
        <p>You agree to indemnify and hold MerjMe and its affiliates, directors,

        and shall be applicable and binding only to the extent that they do not violate
        any applicable laws and are intended to be limited to the extent necessary so
        that they will not render this Agreement illegal, invalid or unenforceable. If
        any provision or portion of any provision of this Agreement shall be held to
        be illegal, invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, it is
        the intention of the parties that the remaining provisions or portions thereof
        shall constitute their agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof,
        and all such remaining provisions or portions thereof shall remain in full force
        and effect.</p>

        <h1>Privacy policy</h1>
        <p> This privacy policy (&quot;Policy&quot;) describes how the personally
        identifiable information (&quot;Personal Information&quot;) you may provide
        on the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://
        MerjMe.com">MerjMe.com</a> website (&quot;Website&quot; or
        &quot;Service&quot;) and any of its related products and services
        (collectively, &quot;Services&quot;) is collected, protected and used. It also
        describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your Personal
        Information and how you can access and update this information. This Policy
        is a legally binding agreement between you (&quot;User&quot;,
        &quot;you&quot; or &quot;your&quot;) and MerjMe (&quot;MerjMe&quot;,
        &quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot; or &quot;our&quot;). By accessing and
        using the Website and Services, you acknowledge that you have read,
        understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Policy. This Policy
        does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control,
        or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.</p>
        <h2>Automatic collection of information</h2>
        <p>Our top priority is customer data security and, as such, we exercise the
        no logs policy. We may process only minimal user data, only as much as it is
        absolutely necessary to maintain the Website and Services. Information
        collected automatically is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and
        establish statistical information regarding the usage and traffic of the
        Website and Services. This statistical information is not otherwise
        aggregated in such a way that would identify any particular user of the
        system.</p>
        <h2>Collection of personal information</h2>
        <p>You can access and use the Website and Services without telling us who
        you are or revealing any information by which someone could identify you as
        a specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to use some of the
        features on the Website, you may be asked to provide certain Personal
        Information (for example, your name and e-mail address). We receive and
        store any information you knowingly provide to us when you create an
        account, publish content, or fill any online forms on the Website. When
        required, this information may include the following:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Personal details such as name, country of residence, etc.</li>
        <li>Contact information such as email address, address, etc.</li>
        <li>Account details such as user name, unique user ID, password, etc.</li>
        <li>Geolocation data such as latitude and longitude.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Some of the information we collect is directly from you via the Website
        and Services. However, we may also collect Personal Information about you
        from other sources such as public databases, social media platforms, thirdparty data providers, and our joint marketing partners. Personal Information
        we collect from other sources may include demographic information, such as
        age and gender, device information, such as IP addresses, location, such as
        city and state, and online behavioral data, such as information about your
        use of social media websites, page view information and search results and
        links. You can choose not to provide us with your Personal Information, but
        then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the features on the
        Website. Users who are uncertain about what information is mandatory are
        welcome to contact us.</p>
        <h2>Use and processing of collected information</h2>
        <p>In order to make the Website and Services available to you, or to meet a
        legal obligation, we may need to collect and use certain Personal Information.
        If you do not provide the information that we request, we may not be able to
        provide you with the requested products or services. Any of the information
        we collect from you may be used for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Create and manage user accounts</li>
        <li>Respond to inquiries and offer support</li>
        <li>Improve user experience</li>
        <li>Post customer testimonials</li>
        <li>Enforce terms and conditions and policies</li>
        <li>Protect from abuse and malicious users</li>
        <li>Respond to legal requests and prevent harm</li>
        <li>Run and operate the Website and Services</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with
        the Website and Services, where you are located in the world and if one of
        the following applies: (i) you have given your consent for one or more
        specific purposes; this, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of
        Personal Information is subject to European data protection law; (ii) provision
        of information is necessary for the performance of an agreement with you
        and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii) processing is
        necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject;
        (iv) processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or
        in the exercise of official authority vested in us; (v) processing is necessary
        for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third
        party.</p>
        <p> Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process
        information until you object to such processing (by opting out), without
        having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases below. In
        any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to
        the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal
        Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement
        necessary to enter into a contract.</p>
        <h2>Managing information</h2>
        <p>You are able to delete certain Personal Information we have about you.
        The Personal Information you can delete may change as the Website and
        Services change. When you delete Personal Information, however, we may
        maintain a copy of the unrevised Personal Information in our records for the
        duration necessary to comply with our obligations to our affiliates and
        partners, and for the purposes described below. If you would like to delete
        your Personal Information or permanently delete your account, you can do so
        on the settings page of your account on the Website.</p>
        <h2>Disclosure of information</h2>
        <p> Depending on the requested Services or as necessary to complete any
        transaction or provide any service you have requested, we may share your
        information with your consent with our trusted third parties that work with us,
        any other affiliates and subsidiaries we rely upon to assist in the operation of
        the Website and Services available to you. We do not share Personal
        Information with unaffiliated third parties. These service providers are not
        authorized to use or disclose your information except as necessary to
        perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements. We may
        share your Personal Information for these purposes only with third parties
        whose privacy policies are consistent with ours or who agree to abide by our
        policies with respect to Personal Information. These third parties are given
        Personal Information they need only in order to perform their designated
        functions, and we do not authorize them to use or disclose Personal
        Information for their own marketing or other purposes.</p>
        <p>We will disclose any Personal Information we collect, use or receive if
        required or permitted by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar
        legal process, and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary
        to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate
        fraud, or respond to a government request.</p>
        <p>In the event we go through a business transition, such as a merger or
        acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your
        user account, and Personal Information will likely be among the assets
        transferred.</p>
        <h2>Retention of information</h2>
        <p>We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary
        to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our
        agreements unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
        We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your
        Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that
        would identify you personally. Once the retention period expires, Personal
        Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to
        erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be
        enforced after the expiration of the retention period.</p>
        <h2>The rights of users</h2>
        <p>You may exercise certain rights regarding your information processed by
        us. In particular, you have the right to do the following: (i) you have the right
        to withdraw consent where you have previously given your consent to the
        processing of your information; (ii) you have the right to object to the
        processing of your information if the processing is carried out on a legal
        basis other than consent; (iii) you have the right to learn if information is
        being processed by us, obtain disclosure regarding certain aspects of the
        processing and obtain a copy of the information undergoing processing; (iv)
        you have the right to verify the accuracy of your information and ask for it to
        be updated or corrected; (v) you have the right, under certain circumstances,
        to restrict the processing of your information, in which case, we will not
        process your information for any purpose other than storing it; (vi) you have
        the right, under certain circumstances, to obtain the erasure of your Personal
        Information from us; (vii) you have the right to receive your information in a
        structured, commonly used and machine readable format and, if technically
        feasible, to have it transmitted to another controller without any hindrance.
        This provision is applicable provided that your information is processed by
        automated means and that the processing is based on your consent, on a
        contract which you are part of or on pre-contractual obligations thereof.</p>
        <h2>Privacy of children</h2>
        <p>We recognize the need to provide further privacy protections with
        respect to Personal Information we may collect from children and take many
        special precautions to protect the privacy of children. Parents can review
        their child's information, delete it, and refuse to allow any further collection
        or use of such information. We encourage children to consult with their
        parents before submitting any information to any online resource , including
        our Website and Services. We believe parents should be involved in the
        online activities of their children and suggest that parents do their best to
        provide their children with a safe and friendly online environment.</p>

        <h2>Do Not Track signals</h2>
        <p>Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to
        websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked.
        Tracking is not the same as using or collecting information in connection with
        a website. For these purposes, tracking refers to collecting personally
        identifiable information from consumers who use or visit a website or online
        service as they move across different websites over time. How browsers
        communicate the Do Not Track signal is not yet uniform. As a result, the
        Website and Services are not yet set up to interpret or respond to Do Not
        Track signals communicated by your browser. Even so, as described in more
        detail throughout this Policy, we limit our use and collection of your personal
        information.</p>
        <h2>Advertisements</h2>
        <p>We may display online advertisements and we may share aggregated and
        non-identifying information about our customers that we or our advertisers
        collect through your use of the Website and Services. We do not share
        personally identifiable information about individual customers with
        advertisers. In some instances, we may use this aggregated and nonidentifying information to deliver tailored advertisements to the intended
        audience.</p>
        <p>We may also permit certain third party companies to help us tailor
        advertising that we think may be of interest to users and to collect and use
        other data about user activities on the Website. These companies may
        deliver ads that might place cookies and otherwise track user behavior.</p>
        <h2>Links to other resources</h2>
        <p>The Website and Services contain links to other resources that are not
        owned or controlled by us. Please be aware that we are not responsible for
        the privacy practices of such other resources or third parties. We encourage
        you to be aware when you leave the Website and Services and to read the
        privacy statements of each and every resource that may collect Personal
        Information.</p>
        <h2>Information security</h2>
        <p>We secure information you provide on computer servers in a controlled,
        secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
        We maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards in
        an effort to protect against unauthorized access, use, modification, and
        disclosure of Personal Information in its control and custody. However, no
        data transmission over the Internet or wireless network can be guaranteed.
        Therefore, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, you
        acknowledge that (i) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet
        which are beyond our control; (ii) the security, integrity, and privacy of any
        and all information and data exchanged between you and the Website and
        Services cannot be guaranteed; and (iii) any such information and data may
        be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party, despite best efforts.</
        p>
        <h2>Data breach</h2>
        <p>In the event we become aware that the security of the Website and
        Services has been compromised or users Personal Information has been
        disclosed to unrelated third parties as a result of external activity, including,
        but not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve the right to take
        reasonably appropriate measures, including, but not limited to, investigation
        and reporting, as well as notification to and cooperation with law
        enforcement authorities. In the event of a data breach, we will make
        reasonable efforts to notify affected individuals if we believe that there is a
        reasonable risk of harm to the user as a result of the breach or if notice is
        otherwise required by law. When we do, we will send you an email.</p>
        <h2>Changes and amendments</h2>

        may also provide notice to you in other ways in our discretion, such as
        through contact information you have provided. Any updated version of this
        Policy will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Policy
        unless otherwise specified. Your continued use of the Website and Services
        after the effective date of the revised Policy (or such other act specified at
        that time) will constitute your consent to those changes. However, we will
        not, without your consent, use your Personal Information in a manner
        materially different than what was stated at the time your Personal

        <h1>DMCA policy</h1>
        <p>This Digital Millennium Copyright Act policy (&quot;Policy&quot;) applies
        to the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://
        MerjMe.com">MerjMe.com</a> website (&quot;Website&quot; or
        &quot;Service&quot;) and any of its related products and services
        (collectively, &quot;Services&quot;) and outlines how MerjMe
        (&quot;MerjMe&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot; or &quot;our&quot;)
        addresses copyright infringement notifications and how you
        (&quot;you&quot; or &quot;your&quot;) may submit a copyright infringement
        complaint.</p>
        <p>Protection of intellectual property is of utmost importance to us and we
        ask our users and their authorized agents to do the same. It is our policy to
        expeditiously respond to clear notifications of alleged copyright infringement
        that comply with the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act
        (&quot;DMCA&quot;) of 1998, the text of which can be found at the U.S.
        Copyright Office <a target="_blank" href="https://
        www.copyright.gov">website</a>.</p>
        <h2>What to consider before submitting a copyright complaint</h2>
        <p>Before submitting a copyright complaint to us, consider whether the use
        could be considered fair use. Fair use states that brief excerpts of
        copyrighted material may, under certain circumstances, be quoted verbatim
        for purposes such as criticism, news reporting, teaching, and research,
        without the need for permission from or payment to the copyright holder. If
        you have considered fair use, and you still wish to continue with a copyright
        complaint, you may want to first reach out to the user in question to see if
        you can resolve the matter directly with the user.</p>
        <p>Please note that under 17 U.S.C. § 512(f), you may be liable for any
        damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees incurred by us or our users, if
        you knowingly misrepresent that the material or activity is infringing. If you
        are unsure whether the material you are reporting is in fact infringing, you
        may wish to contact an attorney before filing a notification with us.</p>
        <p>We may, at our discretion or as required by law, share a copy of your
        notification or counter-notification with third parties. This may include
        sharing the information with the account holder engaged in the allegedly
        infringing activity or for publication. If you are concerned about your
        information being forwarded, you may wish to <a target="_blank"
        href="https://www.copyrighted.com/professional-takedowns">hire an
        agent</a> to report infringing material for you.</p>
        <h2>Notifications of infringement</h2>
        <p>If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof, and you believe that any
        material available on our Services infringes your copyrights, then you may
        submit a written copyright infringement notification
        (&quot;Notification&quot;) using the contact details below pursuant to the
        DMCA by providing us with the following information:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Identification of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed,
        or, if multiple copyrighted works are covered by this Notification, you may
        provide a representative list of the copyrighted works that you claim have
        been infringed.</li>
        <li>Identification of the infringing material and information you claim is
        infringing (or the subject of infringing activity), including at a minimum, if
        applicable, the URL or URLs of the web pages where the allegedly infringing
        material may be found.</li>
        <li>Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact you, such as an
        address, telephone number, and, if available, an e-mail address.</li>
        <li>A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in
        the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, the
        copyright owner's agent, or the law.</li>
        <li>A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under
        penalty of perjury that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an
        exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</li>
        <li>A physical or electronic signature (typing your full name will suffice) of
        the copyright owner or a person authorized to act on their behalf.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All such Notifications must comply with the DMCA requirements. You
        may refer to a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.websitepolicies.com/
        create/dmca-takedown-notice">DMCA takedown notice generator</a> or
        other similar services to avoid making mistake and ensure compliance of
        your Notification.</p>
        <p>Filing a DMCA complaint is the start of a pre-defined legal process. Your
        complaint will be reviewed for accuracy, validity, and completeness. If your
        complaint has satisfied these requirements, our response may include the
        removal or restriction of access to allegedly infringing material as well as a
        permanent termination of repeat infringers’ accounts. We may also require a
        court order from a court of competent jurisdiction, as determined by us in
        our sole discretion, before we take any action. A backup of the terminated
        account’s data may be requested, however it may be subject to certain
        penalty fees imposed. The final penalty fee will be determined by the severity
        and frequency of the violations.</p>
        <p>If we remove or restrict access to materials or terminate an account in
        response to a Notification of alleged infringement, we will make a good faith
        effort to contact the affected user with information concerning the removal
        or restriction of access, which may include a full copy of your Notification
        (including your name, address, phone, and email address), along with
        instructions for filing a counter-notification.</p>
        <p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any portion of this
        Policy, MerjMe reserves the right to take no action upon receipt of a DMCA
        copyright infringement notification if it fails to comply with all the
        requirements of the DMCA for such notifications.</p>
        <h2>Counter-notifications</h2>
        <p>A user who receives a copyright infringement Notification may make a
        counter-Notification pursuant to sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the US
        Copyright Act. If you receive a copyright infringement Notification, it means
        that the material described in the Notification has been removed from our
        Services or access to the material has been restricted. Please take the time
        to read through the Notification, which includes information on the
        Notification we received. To file a counter-notification with us, you must
        provide a written communication compliant with the DMCA requirements.</
        p>
        <p>Please note that you may be liable for, including costs and attorneys’
        fees incurred by us or our users, if you knowingly misrepresent that the
        material or activity is not infringing the copyrights of others or that the
        material or activity was removed or restricted by mistake or misidentification.
        Accordingly, if you are not sure whether certain material infringes the
        copyrights of others or that the material or activity was removed or restricted
        by mistake or misidentification, you may wish to contact an attorney before
        filing a counter-notification.</p>
        <p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any portion of this
        Policy, MerjMe reserves the right to take no action upon receipt of a counternotification. If we receive a counter-notification that complies with the terms
        of 17 U.S.C. § 512(g), we may forward it to the person who filed the original
        Notification.</p>
        <p>The process described in this Policy does not limit our ability to pursue
        any other remedies we may have to address suspected infringement.</p>
        <h2>Changes and amendments</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify this Policy or its terms relating to the
        Website and Services at any time, effective upon posting of an updated
        version of this Policy on the Website. When we do, we will revise the updated
        date at the bottom of this page.</p>
